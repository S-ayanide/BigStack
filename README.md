## Description
A Node JS Project where the User gets option to Login, all the user details are stored in Mongo DB. This application has features to post questions in the forum where users can answer them or even upvote them. For the answer to get upvoted the user Object ID has to be fetched from Mongo DB, which also means that the user has to be logged in/authenticated. 

This project is completely deployable and can be used with any FrontEnd. It uses RESTful API and explicitly takes advantages of HTTP methodologies.

## Prerequisites
To run this project on your system you need to meet these criterias:
* Basic understanding of Node.js and JavaScript.
* A terminal app for MacOS and Linux or PowerShell for Windows.
* Node.js v8+ and a Node.js package manager installed locally.

To install Node.js and NPM, use any of the [official Node.js installers](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) provided for your operating system.

## Initialization
Create a project directory named `Bigstack` to hold your application, and make that your working directory.
Use the `npm init` command to create a `package.json` file for your application.

Inside `package.json` set the `'main'` to `"server.js"` as that is going to be our primary end point of the application.

Instead of using the `node` command to run the application, we'll use, a tool called **nodemon** that monitors our application and automatically restarts the server when source code changes. With `node`, we'd have to restart the server manually when changes are made.

Install **nodemon** as a dependency of your Node.js application:
```
npm install nodemon
```
To make nodemon recognize the entry point of our application we need to map it with our main javaScript file. To do that open `package.json` and add the following line, after main:
```
"scripts": {
    "start": "node server.js"
 }
```

## Dependencies Used
* [Express](https://expressjs.com/)
* [Body Parser](https://www.npmjs.com/package/body-parser)
* [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/)
* [Passport](https://www.npmjs.com/package/passport)
* [Passport-JWT](https://www.npmjs.com/package/passport-jwt)
* [Bycrypt.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcryptjs)
* [Validator](https://www.npmjs.com/package/validator)
* [JSON Web Tokens](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsonwebtoken)

To install these dependencies simply type this in the terminal:
```
npm install express body-parser mongoose passport bcryptjs passport-jwt validator jsonwebtoken
```
`--save` is not required to be typed since after node v5+ release all the packages are automatically saved inside `package.json`

## NOTE:
This project is subject to change by the developer and is still in development
